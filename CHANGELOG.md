# Changelog

All notable changes to kb-switcher are recorded here. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased] — 0.1.0-alpha.0

The initial scaffolding lands across Phases 0–8 documented in
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). Highlights:

### Added

* Cargo workspace with seven crates: `kb-app`, `kb-core`,
  `kb-input`, `kb-layout`, `kb-detect`, `kb-ai`, `kb-types`.
* Pure-Rust runtime: `tao` event loop + `tray-icon` + `global-hotkey`
  + `single-instance`. No WebView, no Node.
* SwitcherEngine: scancode-buffer → per-layout render → detector
  pipeline → corrector. Skips events synthesised by our own
  `KeyEmitter` (avoids feedback loops).
* `WordPlausibilityDetector` — vowel-ratio + consonant-cluster
  heuristic. Catches the canonical "wrong-layout" cases for EN ↔ UK.
* Layout mappings in `data/layout-mappings/*.toml`, embedded via
  `include_str!`. EN-US + UK-UA in v0.1.
* Settings stored as TOML at the OS-canonical config path; reload
  from tray notifies the engine without restart.
* File logs via `tracing-appender` (daily rotation) under the OS
  data dir.
* Tray menu: Open Settings (config.toml in default editor) /
  Open Logs Folder / Reload Settings / Pause / About / Quit.
* Global hotkeys: `Ctrl+Shift+Space` (pause), `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`
  (force-switch the last word).
* AI subsystem scaffold (`kb-ai`, gated by `feature = "ai"`):
  `Detector` + `WordRewriter` plug-in shape, key storage via
  `keyring`, declarative `[[ai.detectors]]` config schema. Concrete
  ONNX/LLM implementations are stubs in v0.1; v0.1.x fills them in.

### Per-OS implementation status

| Platform | Listener | Layout switcher | Emitter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows 10 / 11 | `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` (working) | `LoadKeyboardLayout` + `WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST` (working) | `SendInput` + `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` (working) |
| macOS 14+ | `CGEventTap` (best-effort, validated on CI) | Carbon TIS (best-effort) | `CGEventPost` + Unicode string (best-effort) |
| Linux Wayland | `evdev` (best-effort, requires `setup-linux.sh`) | Hyprland / KDE / GSettings (GNOME, Ubuntu Unity, Cinnamon, Budgie, Pantheon, MATE) / IBus / Fcitx5 — probed in that order | `uinput` + Ctrl+Shift+U (best-effort) |
| Linux X11 | stub (v0.1.x) | KDE / GSettings / IBus / Fcitx5 work the same on X11; raw `XkbLockGroup` fallback in v0.1.x | stub (v0.1.x) |

### Documentation

* `docs/PLAN.md` — architecture, roadmap, decisions log.
* `docs/DECISIONS.md` — non-obvious technical choices with reasoning.
* `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` — per-OS access requirements.
* `docs/AI.md` — AI subsystem privacy + plug-in API.

### Real Hunspell-grade dictionaries (~8M inflected forms)

Detection now consults proper per-language dictionaries instead of a
hand-curated 280-word list. Sources (see `data/wordlists/CREDITS.md`):

* **EN**: `dwyl/english-words` — Public Domain — ~370k entries.
* **UK / RU / DE / ES / FR**: LibreOffice Hunspell dictionaries
  (`*.dic` + `*.aff`) — MPL / GPL / etc., per-language.

`xtask/src/hunspell.rs` parses each language's `.aff` rules and
expands every `<stem>/<flags>` entry in the `.dic` into the full
set of inflected surface forms. Coverage per language:

| Lang | Stems  | Surface forms |
|------|-------:|--------------:|
| en   | —      |    370 105    |
| uk   | 350656 |  3 486 848    |
| ru   | 146269 |  1 436 553    |
| de   | 258202 |    789 398    |
| es   |  58221 |    652 463    |
| fr   |  84139 |  2 139 550    |

Storage is a [BurntSushi FST](https://docs.rs/fst) Set built at
compile time from `data/wordlists/<id>.txt` and embedded via
`include_bytes!`. The FST encoding keeps lookup at O(len(word))
with no per-word allocation; the on-disk size grows roughly
linearly with the form count.

User overlay: drop additional words into
`<config-dir>/kb-switcher/wordlists/<id>.txt` to extend any
dictionary with project-specific vocabulary at startup.

Refresh upstream: `cargo xtask wordlists fetch` re-downloads `.dic`
+ `.aff` for each language, re-runs the expander, and writes a
fresh `data/wordlists/<id>.txt`.

### Dev-friendly: keeps quiet in IDEs and on identifiers

Auto-switching skips:

* the foreground app is on `[exceptions].disabled_apps` — defaults
  cover VS Code / Cursor, every JetBrains IDE, Sublime, Zed,
  Neovide, Windows Terminal, alacritty / kitty / wezterm, PowerShell
  / cmd, and friends; case-insensitive basename match.
* the just-finished token looks like a code identifier
  (`snake_case`, `camelCase`, `letter+digit`, or contains code
  punctuation). Acronyms and ordinary capitalised prose are not
  flagged.

Both filters apply to *automatic* decisions only — the manual switch
hotkey `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` always works, so devs can fix
wrong-layout identifiers or write multi-language comments by
explicitly asking the engine to act.

### Beta installers via GitHub Actions

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
builds three platform-native installers in parallel and attaches
them to a draft GitHub Release:

* **Windows** — per-user `.msi` via WiX Toolset 3 (no admin needed,
  no UAC prompt). Start menu shortcut, clean uninstall.
* **macOS** — universal-binary `.dmg` (Intel + Apple Silicon merged
  with `lipo`) containing a tray-only `kb-switcher.app` (`LSUIElement`
  set; no Dock icon).
* **Linux** — `.AppImage` (x86_64) built with `linuxdeploy`. Single
  file, no system install.

Beta builds are **unsigned** — Gatekeeper / SmartScreen will warn
on first launch; the release notes call out the per-OS workaround.
Code signing comes in a later phase.

The packaging scripts under `installers/` are also runnable locally;
see [CONTRIBUTING.md §Releasing](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing).

### Known limitations / v0.1.x targets

* No visual settings GUI — settings live in `config.toml`. iced/egui
  GUI is deferred until macOS / Wayland event-loop behaviour is
  understood (DECISIONS.md, 2026-05-02).
* Linux X11 listener / emitter / layout switcher are stubs.
* macOS / Linux backends are written from documentation and only
  validated by `cargo check` on CI; runtime tuning will land as
  contributors with the right hardware report issues.
* Beta builds are unsigned (no Apple Developer ID, no Windows EV /
  OV cert yet) — code signing tracked for a later phase.
